# Workshop: Using MATLAB with Python

Welcome to the workshop! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore MATLAB and Python exercises using Jupyter notebooks.

Are you new to MATLAB and Python and want to get more context? Check this page: https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/matlab-and-python.html

Also, we'll be using the MATLAB Integration for Jupyter: https://www.mathworks.com/products/reference-architectures/jupyter.html

## GitHub Codespaces ♥️ Jupyter Notebooks
We will be using GitHub Codespaces! Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. 

You will be able to launch & access MATLAB through JupyterLab directly in your browser, by clicking on "Open in Codespaces" inside your repository.

Before you start, please make sure you do the following: 
1. Log in to your GitHub account so you can create a new codespace
2. In your account settings, go to the section for Codespaces and in the Editor Preference select "JupyterLab"
3. Make sure you have a MathWorks account

Additional instructions will be provided during the live workshop. Enjoy!
